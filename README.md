A gui to help in string placements of translations on FAQ images.

```
python gui.py language
```

Select string by pressing `1` (question string), `2` (answer string), `3` (Title string in English).

Increase or decrease the font size with `i` or `d`, respectively.

Increase or decrease the length of the string by using `l` or `s`, respectively.

Move to the next image by pressing "n".

Save the placements and fonts file using `w` (this can be done at any stage).
